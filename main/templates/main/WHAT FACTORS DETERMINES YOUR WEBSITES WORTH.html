    <h1 class="center"style="color:#263b5e;font-weight: 500;"><strong>What Factors Determine Your Websites Worth?</strong></h1>
    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
      <p style="line-height: 1.5;font-size:1.6rem;">Are you one of those internet marketers who earns a steady income through your content website?</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">Good?</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">We are assuming you are here because you want to have a profitable exit by selling your current website.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">Well, </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;"> For a profitable exit, it is important to know the factors that actually determine the value of a website, especially from the buyer's perspective because he wants to be assured he is going to buy a website that is trustworthy and scalable.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">Now, let us dive into the topic,</p>

        <h2 style="font-weight: 600;">What Factors Influence a Websites Value ?</h2>

      	<p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1.9rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">CONTENT :</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin: 0.8rem;">It's a no brainer that "THE" most important factor that shows the potential of a website is Content, Period. It is important that the content you write is appealing in all the keywords just for the heck of it. Also , be careful of Plagiarism and check out some of the tools available on Google.</p>
        <img src="../../static/main/images/factors2 (1).jpg" alt="Seo-friendlyContent" style="width: 100%;"> 
        <p style="font-size: 1rem;color:#6e7a75;text-decoration: underline;">Source: <a style=""href="https://www.semrush.com/"> SemRush</a></p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">In terms of Buyer's perspective , he looks at content, checks it is relevant to your niche, and also want to be assured that he has the opportunity to optimize the content to reach out to more people. Curating a good content strategy is important for a website to look more “AUTHORITATIVE” and at the same time, it helps the seller demand a higher valuation. </p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">BACKLINKS :</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">A clean backlink profile always gets you a better valuation when compared to a spammy backlink profile. When we say clean it means the links that you have built must be relevant to your niche and should have a decent Domain rating.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin: 0.8rem;">Links are built to make your site look more authoritative and it also assures the buyer that the website is clean and is not filled with spammy links that have come through blog commenting, links that aren’t relevant to your niche, etc.</p>
        <img src="../../static/main/images/factors 3.jpg" alt="Backlinks Profile" style="width: 100%;">
        <p style="font-size: 1rem;color:#6e7a75;text-decoration: underline;">Source: <a style=""href="https://www.semrush.com/"> SemRush</a></p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">At the same time try not to focus too much on the backlink part because then you might get distracted and adhere to Black-hat strategies, which is not at all recommended. Write great pieces of content and you have a possibility to land backlinks to your website in a much more organic way.</p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">TRAFFIC :</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin: 0.8rem;" >The number of people viewing your website on a daily basis kind of gives you an idea of how well the content is received. As they say, “The more the merrier” but it only counts if it has come in an organic manner, meaning you are actually pulling the viewers rather than pushing them through Ads.</p> 
        <img src="../../static/main/images/factors 3 (2).jpg" alt="Traffic analytics" style="width: 100%;">
        <p style="font-size: 1rem;color:#6e7a75;text-decoration: underline;">Source: <a style=""href="https://www.semrush.com/"> SemRush</a></p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">But it’s funny that Google keeps changing its algorithm and your traffic may vary, so it’s important to be on your toes by checking the trends, page views, geographical location of the viewers, etc. But the fact of the matter is if your website can embrace the google algorithm and still manage to get a decent amount of traffic, you know that your site is sturdy and eventually you will end up with a profitable exit. </p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">PASSIVE OR ACTIVE :</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">Another Important factor in determining the value of a website is to check the no.of hours required per week to run the particular website. It is important that day-to-day activities are systemized and organized. If it is more of passive income then the overall website might be valued at a higher price when compared to a website that requires the buyer to put in a lot of effort.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;"> As a seller, it is important to understand that buyers will prefer to buy those websites that require minimal effort and give maximum output. </p>

        <p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">SOCIAL PROOF AND MONETIZATION :</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin: 0.8rem;">When we say social proof it means that the website should be having a presence in all social media platforms depending on the niche. It is a known fact that some parts of the traffic come through your social media and it is important to level up your social media game. The number of followers on your social media channels will give you a better valuation.</p>
        
        <div class="center"style="margin:1.4rem;"><img src="../../static/main/images/factors 5.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="Social proof"></div>
        

        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">The same case with the E-mail subscribers as well, the more number of people that subscribe to your newsletter the better it is for the buyers, as he has the opportunity to monetize his e-mail list.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">MONETIZATION :</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin: 0.8rem;">You must know that Google or Amazon can always keep fiddling with Terms of Service, sometimes by changing the commission structure or google coming up new updates every now and then, which might affect your traffic as well as monthly income.</p>
        <div class="center" style="margin:1.4rem;"><img src="../../static/main/images/Factors 4.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Multiple monetization channels"></div>
        <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">So to be on the safer side always try to have multiple streams of income so that if one goes down you have the other that can take care of you, and it can also act as an assurance to the buyer that the business will be stable if at all any uncertainty arises. This kind of strategy can actually give you a slightly better price to your website</p>
        
        <div style="padding: 1rem;border-radius: 1rem;border:4px solid #312a50;">
          <p style="font-weight: 900;color:#312a50;margin-top: 1rem;font-size: 1.7rem;">CONCLUSION :</p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">However, there are more factors that determine the valuation, but the above factors are “THE” most influential factors that actually will help you demand a much higher valuation. So, as a seller ensure that you focus on the above factors to attract potential buyers. </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9;margin-top: 0.8rem;">During the process of due diligence, the buyer also looks at these factors as these determine how legit the website is on the surface level, so it is important that as a seller you check all the above factors before you sell the website.</p>
