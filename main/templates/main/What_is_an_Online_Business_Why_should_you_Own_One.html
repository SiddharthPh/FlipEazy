      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">But Here’s the thing,<br></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">These Businesses are not some kind of “Get Rich quick scheme”. It Involves Hard and smart work like any other Business for that matter. Moreover, It requires the right set of knowledge and skills to run an Online Business.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">So We are going to delve into the topic of What exactly is an Online Business and Why should you Own One? <br>Online Businesses are Businesses that help people earn money through the Internet.<br></p><br>

      	<p style="line-height: 2.1;background-color: #FAFAD2;font-weight: 500;">It is much easier to run an online business when compared to your traditional Brick and mortar Businesses, the reason being it is not capital intensive and ROI is crazy for the amount of time you put in.</p>

      	<p class="content">Also, it is in the hands of the Owner to decide on what kind of business model can actually suit them based on their Interests and their area of Expertise.<br>Now let us take a look at Different Online Business models that you can cash in on:</p>
     
	  <p class="side-headings">GOOGLE ADSENSE:</p>
      	 <p class="content"> We’ve all come across this platform and it is one of the prominent ways to earn money online. When you integrate this platform on your blog and you drive traffic to your content site and when the people who read your blog start clicking on the ads, Google pays you a fixed amount. If your content game is on point, then the ROI is crazy.</p>
      
      <p class="side-headings">AMAZON AFFILAITE :</p> 
      	<p class="content">If you are a newbie and you’ve just entered the online business world, we recommend that you start off with an Amazon affiliate. Since Amazon is a trusted brand, the conversion rate is much higher especially when you are reviewing various Products. At the same time, there are various platforms like amazon wherein you can sign-up as an affiliate and build a website around those products. But the conversion rate might not be high when compared to Amazon, unless and until the product or the niche you are in is actually solving a particular problem.</p>
      <p class="side-headings">DROPSHIPPING :</p> 	
      	<p class="content">Dropshipping has been attracting a lot of eyeballs as it does not involve spending money on product research, warehousing, etc. All you have to do is to set up that perfect sales funnel so that the manufacturer can directly ship it to the customer. The profit margins are lean when compared to your traditional E-commerce Business, but if you are a digital marketing expert, these kinds of businesses are highly scalable. Most of the dropshipping websites are actually hosted on Shopify.</p> 
      
      <p class="side-headings">INFO PRODUCTS :</p> 	
      	<p class="content">If you’ve been on the internet for a decent amount of time then you must have come across various websites where someone is selling an Ebook On weight loss or on How to earn money online etc. You need not limit yourself to only these topics; it can range from dating advice to financial guidance to teaching How to communicate and stuff like these which are actually Informative.  Once the info product is ready and people are buying, you can actually scale it to the next level.</p>

But there are a lot of factors to be considered before valuing the website.</p>
